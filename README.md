## ⚙️ Installation

### 📋 Prerequisites

- Grafana (v11.0.0 or higher)
- Plugins required by specific dashboards (see individual dashboard documentation)
- Data sources configured as required by specific dashboards

### 🔽 Import via Grafana UI

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IT-BAER/grafana.git
```

2. Navigate to the directory of the dashboard you want to import (e.g., `dashboards/unbound-dns/`)
3. In Grafana, navigate to **Dashboards** → **+ Import**
4. Click on **Upload JSON file** and select the `dashboard.json` file from the dashboard's directory
5. Before finalizing the import, ensure the dashboard is using your working data sources
6. Copy any assets from the dashboard's `assets` folder to your Grafana's public assets directory (if required by the specific dashboard)

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

If images are not displaying properly for any dashboard:

1. Verify that the assets were copied to the correct location
2. Check Browser Dev Tools for any path-related errors
3. Ensure the image paths in the dashboard JSON match where you placed the assets
4. Refer to the specific dashboard's documentation for additional troubleshooting steps
